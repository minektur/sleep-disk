# I tried a lot of different things to detect clamshell mode and do something clever to make
# it sleep right, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to easily disable clamshell
# on Mojave.  The 'sleep for a while' method has solved my problem but seems a little hacky
# Come on Apple - how hard should it be to have my mbp actually sleep when I close the lid?
# Whether or not I have an external monitor shouldn't affect things, or at least should be
# configurable.

# here are the many ways I found to detect from shell whether I had a second monitor or not



# commands that have different output when in clamshell mode/laptop-display closed

#the cannonical way that people say to use, all over the internet
